                    <p>The digital world has changed the job and business landscape drastically, where information technology skills and digital expertise have become much needed. Education must be able to accommodate these changes by providing a curriculum that includes learning about technology, problem solving skills, programming, and digital literacy. In this way, individuals will be ready to face the demands of future work and be able to adapt to ever-changing technological developments.</p>
                    <p>Apart from that, education also has an important role in teaching critical skills and information literacy. In this digital era, information is abundant and easily accessible to anyone. However, not all existing information can be considered valid or correct. Therefore, education must provide quality teaching on how to carry out critical analysis of the information encountered, distinguish between facts and opinions, and respect reliable sources of information. Education in the digital era must also encourage creativity and collaboration. The existence of technology such as computers, the internet and social media provides new space for collaboration between individuals and the creation of creative content. Through education that supports these skills, individuals will be taught to think critically, face problems innovatively, and work together in teams. In an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world, this capability becomes an invaluable added value.</p>
                    <p>In facing the challenges of the digital era, education has an important role in preparing future generations and fueling the spirit of innovation. Rapid change requires adaptive and progressive education, with a focus on learning technology skills, information literacy, creativity, and collaboration. Only through inclusive education will individuals have equal opportunities in facing an increasingly complex and global future</p>

                    <p>It's hot during the day, but suddenly it rains at night. Sudden and erratic weather changes like now are a sign that we are entering a transition season. What is a transition season? The transition season is a transition period from the dry season to the forest season or vice versa.</p>
                    <p>In seasons like this, our bodies are forced to adapt to changing air conditions and temperatures. Not only that, this season is also the preferred time for viruses and bacteria to multiply quickly. So it is not surprising that someone who has a low immune system will easily be affected by various diseases, especially babies and toddlers whose immune systems are still not perfect.</p>
                    <p>The following are healthy tips during the transition season that you must know, including:</br>
                    1. Eat lots of nutritious food</br>
                    2. Get enough rest</br>
                    3. Exercise</br>
                    4. Drink Water</p>
